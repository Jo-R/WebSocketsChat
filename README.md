Aim of this is to learn about web sockets.

Currently I'be just taken the code from https://peterdaugaardrasmussen.com/2019/01/20/how-to-use-websockets-with-asp-net-core-with-an-example/
and adapted it to React to just get something happening..

Then I will start adapting it further so I can send a message back to the back end...and build it up to be able to have the React cllient open in two sessions and see updates from one to the other.

Since the goal overall is to dig more into how web sockets work I'll look at this https://radu-matei.com/blog/aspnet-core-websockets-middleware/ as well.
